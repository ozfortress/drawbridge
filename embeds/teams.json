      "description": "### Match Communication\nA reminder: __**ALL**__ inter-team communication related to your matches must occur within the weekly generated match channels in this Discord. Failure to do so will result in penalties as per [7.2. Team Captain Discord](https://docs.ozfortress.com/rules/global/#72-team-captain-discord).\n\n### Why does this channel exist?\nThis channel is to allow you to reach out directly to administrators for team or match support. Please only ping your division administrator **once**. Excessive pings will get you slapped.\n\n### Admin Shopping Notice\nPlease do yourselves and us a favour - read [1.5. Admin Shopping](https://docs.ozfortress.com/rules/global/?h=admin+sho#15-admin-shopping). If you receive a ruling you feel is unfair, please elevate it to a more senior administrator (the format's Head Admin or the League Director).",
